Bug reports can be sent to me on discord too. Joining discord does not auto give you access to the server, but I may let you access depending on who you are.\n\n[url=https://discord.gg/eHKNyBGRKb] Discord Invite Link [/url]\n\n[h1]Direct Download[/h1]\nAll my mods are available for direct download from my discord server.
