	"description": "[h1]Original Mod[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1959174056\n(Please send all love for the builders bench idea to that page)\n\nThis mod only exists because of the amazing work Absolute Pheonix did in continuing the Builder's Workbench Idea. Thank You!\n\nIf you want the Builder's Bench without the excess benches ... (ie ... you only want the recipes out of the inventory) .... use Absolute Pheonix's version.\n\n[h1]Description[/h1]\nCompat - (Uses ID's 7531#####)\nDo not use this mod and Absolute Pheonix's Version together ... they should be fine but they do the same thing so pick which one you want and use that one only. Mod load order is the same either way.\n\nThis mod adds more Builder's Benches to seperate the recipes for easier sorting. The base bench from the base mod is still fully operational with this mod, so users can pick which benches they wish to use. The added benches are crafted in the base mods bench. The extra benches use the Sherpa Pack mesh so they are small and easy to place around the main bench.\n\nADDED BENCHES:\n- each dlc has a bench\n- combined dlc bench\n- each mod has a bench (only supported mods obviously)\n- combined mods bench\n- vanilla game bench\n\nThe benches from this mod work identically to the base mods ... Mason Thralls do not work in this mods benches. I will attempt to keep this mod updated as to mod support from Builder's Workbench Reborn, however if I do not get an update out ... the missing items will always be found in the base mods benches (the ones crafted in the inventory)\n\n[h1]Load Order[/h1]\nPippi\nAny mod that modifies or creates new buildings, placeables, pets, or thralls.\nPythagoras mods\nLBPR - Additional Features\nLBPR - Fish and Shell Trap Bug Fix\nBuilder's Workbench Reborn Extended\nLBPR\nPickup + or Unlock Plus with Pickup\n\nDO NOT USE BUILDER'S WORKBENCH REBORN AND THIS VERSION TOGETHER ... PICK ONE OR THE OTHER (both work perfectly, so if you don't want the extra benches then just use Absolute Pheonix's version)\n\n[h1]Currently Supported Mods[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1928978003] Northern Timber [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1855055876] Arena Pier [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1113901982] The Age of Calamitous [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=901911361] Glass Construction and more [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1472647650] Limestone Buildings [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=880177231] Pythagoras [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1382183303] Pythagoras Support Beams [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1444947329] LBPR - Additional Features [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1579057391] Stygian Building Kit [/url]\n\n[h1]CREDIT[/h1]\nAbsolute Phoenix's great mod Builder's Workbench Reborn\n(Remake of Builder's Workbench v1.0.3 by Fenyx)\nThank you for all the work you did on this mod.\n\nAssets used from Absolute Phoenix's mod are under the MIT licence.\n\nThis mod is under the MIT licence.\n\n[h1] Modding and Server Discord [/h1]\nI have a discord server for both my mods, and my servers.

Only the most recent update will be saved.",
	"changeNote": "- complete redo of all meshes to stop using Absolute Pheonix's meshes for new benches (standard bench left the same though)\n- removed final parts of mod to make it standalone (remaining thrall code and other old stuff)\n\n- this update will change the mesh of all benches but the default one, however all your stuff will be fine (you may want to move the benches though as the new model is the sherpa pack not a bench)\n- this was done to allow tighter placement",
